# ProjectX - Web Application

## Overview

ProjectX is a web application aimed at building a responsive and user-friendly platform. This repository is used for version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.

## Repository Structure

The repository has been initialized on GitHub with the following structure:

- `src`: Contains the source code for the web application.
- `docs`: Includes documentation related to the project.
- `tests`: Holds testing-related files.

## Branching and Initial Development

### Branches Created

- `feature/add-homepage`: A new branch created for developing the one-page website.
- `feature/add-about-page`: Another branch created for adding an about page.

### Website Development

A one-page website has been developed within the `src` folder, including sections such as a header, about, services, and contact. Changes were committed with clear and descriptive commit messages.

## Collaboration and Pull Requests

Another student has been invited to collaborate on the repository. The following actions were taken:

1. [Tapiwanashe Mlambo](https://github.com/tapiwamla/) created a branch named `feature/add-about-page`.
2. Changes related to an about page were made, and a pull request was submitted to merge it into the main branch.
3. A review was conducted, providing constructive comments and suggestions for improvement.

## Merging and Conflict Resolution

1. The `feature/add-about-page` branch was merged into the main branch.
2. A deliberate conflict was introduced between the main branch and the `feature/add-homepage` branch by modifying the same line in a file.
3. The conflict was resolved, and changes were committed.

## Version Control Analysis and Problem-solving

1. A bug was intentionally introduced in the code of one of the branches.
2. Git commands were used to identify the commit that introduced the bug.
3. Steps to rectify the bug were explained.

This README provides an overview of the actions taken during the lab exam, including repository structure, branching, development, collaboration, merging, conflict resolution, and version control analysis.
